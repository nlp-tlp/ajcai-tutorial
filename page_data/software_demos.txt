QuickGraph
A collaborative annotation tool for rapid multi-task information extraction for knowledge graph construction.
QuickGraph is a web-based annotation tool for collaborative multi-task information extraction. Key features of QuickGraph are its support for complex entity and relation annotation tasks, and its novel use of semantic clustering and real-time annotation graph construction that aid annotator efficiency and consistency.

Echidna
A Knowledge Graph for Maintenance
This tool offers maintainers and reliability engineers a completely novel and powerful way to analyse their work orders. While it is still a work in progress, in its current state it allows users to filter and query work orders by using knowledge captured within both the work order text and the structured fields (e.g. "Date" and "Functional location description").

Redcoat
A Collaborative Annotation Tool for Hierarchical Entity Typing
Redcoat is a web-based annotation tool that supports collaborative hierarchical entity typing. As an annotation tool, Redcoat also facilitates knowledge elicitation by allowing the creation and continuous refinement of concept hierarchies during annotation.

Text2KG
An Automated Text to Knowledge Graph System
Text2kg is a system for converting raw text into a knowledge graph via an NLP pipeline. Our system uses a pipeline-based approach to extract a set of triples from a given document. It offers a simple and effective solution to the challenge of knowledge graph construction from domain-specific text. Text2kg was our entry to the ICDM 2019 Knowledge Graph Contest, where we won first prize.
