            "description": "The resources sector captures vast data about the history of its assets held in structured and unstructured text fields. This project aims to construct knowledge graphs from maintenance work orders in order to visualise historic asset data, provide decision support to reliability engineers, and allow for easy identification of failure modes.",

            "description": "Integrating the representative ability of deep neural network with probabilistic logical reasoning is still an open and a challenging problem. It brings expensive computation cost due to the exponentially large searching space in knowledge representation and knowledge compilation. Ziyu's research interest is to combine deep learning with logic and probability theory for linguistics computing, taking into account knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning.",

Automatically extracting key information, which is buried within a large amount of textual data, through knowledge graph construction is vital to support intelligent applications for knowledge discovery."

Given the advances of knowledge graph embeddings and their use in link prediction, codified logical understanding at a class level can be used to further improve these links and associated knowledge graphs."

The purpose of this project is to extract information into a machine readable format, while preserving implied relationships such as headers and titles irrespective of domain, through a hybrid computer vision and rule based approach."

This project aims to devise methods for measuring the similarity of content in technical language corpora and evaluate the effectiveness of these methods."
