            "article": "In 2019 the NLP research group at UWA entered the 2019 ICDM Knowledge Graph Contest. The goal of the competition was to construct a knowledge graph from scratch from news articles across various domains, such as catering news and automotive news.<br/>Our team, consisting of Dr Wei Liu, Michael Stewart, Majiga Enkhsaikhan, Tom Smoker and Morgan Lewis experimented with a variety of different approaches ranging from rule-based methods to fully end-to-end deep learning methods. We ultimately found the rule-based methods produced the most accurate knowledge graph, which cemented our place in the second round of the competition.<br/>In the second round, we were tasked with developing a visualisation of our knowledge graph. We took this opportunity to develop <a href=\"https://nlp-tlp.org/text2kg\" target=\"_blank\">Text2KG</a>, a d3-based app for visualising knowledge graphs constructed directly from text.<br/>Shortly after submitting our entry \"Team UWA\" was announced as the first prize winner of the competition, and we had the opportunity to fly to Beijing to present our work and receive our award. While at the conference we met the father of data mining, Jiawei Han, and the legendary G\u00f6del prize winners Ronald Fagin and Joseph Halpern. The conference was a fantastic opportunity for us all and led us to future exciting research in knowledge graph construction from text.",
